To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

### Git hooks

We use [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/README.md) to manage Git hooks.
- Install Lefthook using the link above
- Run `lefthook install` in the project root

### App Localization

We use [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) to localize the app.
To update the localization keys run:
```
fvm flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -S "assets/translations" -O "lib/core/localization/generated" -f keys
```

### Environment configuration

To regenerate environment configuration files run:
```
fvm flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Firebase configuration

We use [flutterfire_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_cli) to manage Firebase configuration files. Please ensure that you have the version of the CLI at least `0.3.0-dev.16`.  
To generate GoogleService-Info.plist files, run it on MacOS.
To regenerate Firebase configuration files, run the "configure_firebase.bat" script:
```
scripts/configure_firebase.bat
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
